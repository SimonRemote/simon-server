If multiple Mac connetions of same channel, close the most recent try and send an error json
- right now, it overwrites the old connection

If the requested channel is taken, assign a new random one that isn't taken.

Send status to each device on channel when a new device connects
simplify sending of statuses

Maybe adjust seek in applescript for songs that are set to start ealier or finish earlier.

Change itunes control to Back Track from previous track? Depends on speed of network and such

Handle sleep/wake loss/gain of internet on the listener.

When music information is null, actually update the phone with "music not found". Applescript is erroring out and not sending info.

Send an info command when the songs position is greater than the duration give or take 3-5 seconds.

Use delegates to communicate with the views instead of hacking the appdelegate.

Use queue for all messages, including registrations. Maybe set a timeout for the first INFO command.
